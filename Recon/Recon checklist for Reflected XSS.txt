## WSTG-INFO Information Gathering

### WSTG-INFO-01 Fingerprint Web Server
- [X] Server header / banner
- [X] Technologies detected
- Notes
The application content is generated dynamically and relies heavily on server-side rendering.
Client-side JavaScript is minimal and primarily used to support classic postback-driven workflows. 

The front-end shell appears to request data through framework-managed callbacks rather than modern REST-style API
---------------------------------------------------------------------


### WSTG-INFO-02 Review Webserver Metafiles (robots.txt, sitemap.xml) finger print web server 
- [X] robots.txt checked
- [X] sitemap.xml checked
- Notes
Observed characteristics include:
Web server: Microsoft IIS 10.0
Platform: ASP.NET WebForms
.NET Runtime: 4.0.30319
ASP.NET version: 4.8.x
JavaScript delivery via WebResource.axd

Evidence of verbose error handling due to disabled custom error configuration
No indexed pages observed via metadata.

These findings are consistent with a legacy ASP.NET WebForms deployment
---------------------------------------------------------------------



### WSTG-INFO-03 Review Webserver Metafiles for Information Leakage
- [X] Directories enumerated
- [X] Virtual hosts discovered
- Notes
No direct file disclosure was observed during initial enumeration.
Findings were logged for follow-up testing during configuration and access control phases.
---------------------------------------------------------------------


### WSTG-INFO-04 Review Webpage Content
- [X] Comments in HTML
- [X] Hidden fields / tokens
- Notes
The presence of Sys.WebForms.PageRequestManager._initialize confirms usage of ASP.NET AJAX
extensions.

Several endpoints were observed utilizing multiple client-supplied parameters including identifiers,
query values, and event parameters. 

These inputs were flagged for future validation, authorization, and
business logic testing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------


### WSTG-INFO-05 Review Webpage Content for Information Leakage
- [X] Parameters, forms, JSON, headers
- Notes
Verbose error handling was observed, consistent with customErrors="off" , which may expose stack
traces or internal application logic during fault conditions.

Session cookies were observed without the Secure attribute, representing a potential transport-layer
risk depending on deployment context.

Additional application content referenced internal subdomains, indicating a segmented application
ecosystem.
---------------------------------------------------------------------


### WSTG-INFO-06 Identify Application Entry Points
- [X] Navigation flow mapped
- Notes
The application relies heavily on the ASP.NET WebForms model. 

Navigation and state transitions are
driven by server-managed postbacks using hidden fields such as __VIEWSTATE , __EVENTVALIDATION ,
and __doPostBack
---------------------------------------------------------------------


### WSTG-INFO-07 Map Execution Paths Through Application
- [X] Framework version
- Notes
Execution flow is tightly coupled to WebForms postback mechanics.
Application state is preserved and transmitted via hidden fields rather than client-side routing or APIs. 

This architecture increases the importance of input validation, state integrity, and server-side trust boundaries.
---------------------------------------------------------------------


### WSTG-INFO-08/09 Fingerprint Web Application / Map Application Architecture
- [X] App-specific patterns (cookies, tokens)
- [X] Frontend vs Backend
- [X] DB calls inferred
- Notes
Observed architectural traits include:
Standard ASP.NET session handling via ASP.NET_SessionId
X-AspNet-Version header present
.NET Framework 4.x running on IIS 10
Extensive use of __VIEWSTATE and __EVENTVALIDATION
Classic WebForms routing and UI logic
All pages are form-driven with server-side state management

Notably absent:
ASP.NET Core
Razor views (.cshtml)
Client-side frameworks such as Angular, React, or Vue
Modern static asset bundling or build tooling
Overall, the application reflects a traditional ASP.NET WebForms architecture with legacy state
management patterns.
